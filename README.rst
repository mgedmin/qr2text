qr2text
=======

Convert SVG images containing barcodes generated by PyQRCode to ASCII art,
for displaying in a terminal.

Because I'm a weird person who reads mail using Mutt over SSH in a terminal,
and sometimes people send me QR codes for setting up TOTP authentication.

Usage::

    qr2text FILENAME.svg
